# EmotionDetection
### High school project on machine learning using TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV
<b> A model that recognizes emotions and classifies them into 7 categories.

<b> Dataset used (emotion detection) </b>: Fer13
<br>
<b> Final model accuracy (emotion detection) </b>: 68.5% on training set, 63% on test set
<br>
<br>
<b> Dataset used (age detection) </b>: UTKFace
